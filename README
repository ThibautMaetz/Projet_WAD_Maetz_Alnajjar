Sport Website for High level Athletes

1.	Every registered person will have to join the sport he is playing and at what levels (amateur vs pro)
2.	They will be able to show the result of their tournaments to their friends on the application (a share button and a list of friends)
3.	They will be able to send invitations to make friendship.
4.	You will have a new section will all the latest news about the sport they follow
5.  You have the sport, and then the different federations, then the clubs and finally the players
6.  Users can search for a particular player, club, or coach
7.  Maybe we will add the possibility to resell and buy tikets (or at least put the link to the official site)
8.  We need to have 2 categories on the main page, one with the lastest news, and one with the major events coming soon
